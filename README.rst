Headphone indicator

Android app that shows a notification icon in the status bar when
headphones are plugged into the phone.

The app aims to be a tiny as possible.

Runs on Android 4.4+.


===================
Why was it written?
===================
I wrote the headphone indicator app because I was immensely unsatisfied
with apps like `susomena's Headphones Indicator`__ which are over
2 MiB in size, but 99% of their code is only related to advertisement.

My task was to show that you can make it much, much better.
